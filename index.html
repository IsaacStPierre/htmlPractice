        <p1>
            I was born in Eglin AFB to an Air Force Family. <br>
            We moved to Abilene as it was my Father's final duty station. <br>
            After retiring, my father recieved a job offer at Offut AFB. <br>
            And finally, after enlisting Schriever SFB would be my first duty station.

            For Tokyo... why not, you know? Also the location of Shinjuku Gyoen. <br>
            Misawa is where my father and grandmother are from. I just think it'd be peacful place to visit. <br>
            Seoul is where my grandmother was born. I also have alot of extended family still there.
