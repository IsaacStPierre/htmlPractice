    <h1>Cities Lived</h1>
    <p1>
        I was born in Eglin AFB to an Air Force Family. <br>
        We moved to Abilene as it was my Father's final duty station before retiring. <br>
        After retiring, my father recieved a job offer at Offut AFB. <br>
        And finally, after enlisting Schriever SFB would be my first duty station.

    <h1>Cities To Visit</h1>
    <p2>
        For Tokyo... why not, you know? Also the location of Shinjuku Gyoen. <br>
        Misawa is where my father and grandmother are from. I just think it'd be peacful place to visit. <br>
        Seoul is where my grandmother was born. I also have alot of extended family still there.
